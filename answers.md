## The histograms are usually normalized by dividing the result by the sum of all cells. Why is that?

Then the sum of all bins is 1 and the plot is probability distribution that random pixel belongs to the given bin

## Based on the results, which order of erosion and dilation operations produces opening and which closing?

If I close two elements, I create one big, so at first I have to joint with dilatation and then return back with erosion

If I open two elements, I separete theem, so at first I have to separete with erosion and them return back with dilation

## Why is the background included in the mask and not the object? How would you fix that in general? (just inverting the mask if necessary doesnâ€™t count)

Because the object is darker than background. 

Ideas: 
+ check color of corners
+ choose minority color as white
